# Requirement Traceability Matrix
- RTM is a document or matrix that is used to ensure that the requirements defined for a system or software are linked at every point during verification phase.
- It a matrix that gives a clear idea about requirements and test cases relation. In simple words, it is mapping of the requirement, test cases, defects in the simple document.

## What Elements Should an RTM Include?
- Requirements: An identifier or description that explains one feature your project is meant to complete. 
- Test Cases: A plan of inquiry based on a project requirement. Each test is matched with a requirement and vice versa. 
- Project Status: The viability of the project. Did it pass or fail the test?

## Creating a Requirement Traceability Matrix
Creating an RTM is relatively straightforward. Once you have your information, you simply need to fill out your traceability matrix. 
You must also decide what information you want to include in your document. Requirements, test cases, and project status are necessities, but many teams choose to add other data to their RTMs. These extras often include comments, descriptions of requirements and test cases, goals, and more.
