## Types Of Software Testing
- ### Functional Testing: 
  Functional testing is a type of software testing that verifies the functionality of a software system or application. It focuses on ensuring that the system behaves according to the specified functional requirements and meets the intended business needs.
	- #### Integration Testing:
		Integration testing is a level of software testing where individual units are combined and tested as a group. The purpose of this testing is to expose faults in the interaction between integrated units.
	- #### Unit Testing: 
		Unit testing is a type of software testing that focuses on individual units or components of a software application. The purpose of this testing is to ensure that each unit or component of the software application is working as intended.
	- #### Interface Testing: 
		Interface testing is a type of software testing that focuses on the interfaces between software components. The purpose of this testing is to ensure that the components interact correctly and that data is passed between them as expected.
	- #### User Acceptance Testing
		User acceptance testing is a type of software testing that is done to ensure that the software application meets the requirements and specifications of the end-users. The purpose of this testing is to ensure that the software application meets the requirements and specifications of the end-users and that it is ready for release.
	- #### System Testing
		System testing is a type of software testing that tests the entire system as a whole. The purpose of this testing is to ensure that the software application meets the requirements and specifications that were set for it.
	- #### Regression Testing
		Regression testing is a type of software testing that is done to ensure that changes or modifications made to a software application have not introduced new bugs or issues. The purpose of this testing is to ensure that the software application continues to function as intended after changes have been made.
		
- ### Non Functional Testing
	- #### Installation Testing
		Installation testing is a type of software testing that is done to ensure that the software application can be installed and run on different systems and configurations. The purpose of this testing is to ensure that the software application can be installed and run without issues on different systems and configurations.
	- #### Reliability Testing
		Reliability testing is a type of software testing that is done to ensure that the software application is reliable and performs as intended under different conditions. The purpose of this testing is to ensure that the software application is reliable and performs as intended under different conditions.
	- #### Documentation Testing
		Documentation testing is a type of software testing that is done to ensure that the documentation for a software application is accurate and complete. The purpose of this testing is to ensure that the documentation for the software application is accurate and complete.
	- #### Performance Testing
		Performance testing is a type of software testing that is done to ensure that the software application performs as intended under different conditions. The purpose of this testing is to ensure that the software application performs as intended under different conditions, including high load and stress.
	- #### Security Testing
		Security testing is a type of software testing that is done to ensure that the software application is secure and protected against unauthorized access and attacks. The purpose of this testing is to ensure that the software application is secure and protected against unauthorized access and attacks.


## Bug Life Cycle
Bug life cycle is the process followed by the development team to track and fix bugs in a software application. The bug life cycle typically includes the following stages: new, open, assigned, fixed, verified, and closed.

## Software Test Plan
- **Introduction**: This section provides an overview of the test plan, including its purpose, scope, objectives, and any relevant background information. 

- **Test Objectives**: It outlines the specific goals and objectives of the testing effort, such as identifying defects, validating functionality, and ensuring compliance with requirements.

- **Test Scope:** It defines the boundaries and limitations of the testing effort. It specifies what aspects of the software will be tested, as well as what will not be tested.

- **Test Schedule:** This section provides a timeline for the testing activities, including milestones, deadlines, and dependencies. It helps in tracking the progress of testing and ensuring that it aligns with the project schedule.

- **Test Deliverables:** It lists the documents and artifacts that will be produced as part of the testing process, such as test cases, test scripts, test data, test reports, and any other relevant documentation.

- **Test Environment:** This component describes the hardware, software, and network configurations required for testing. It includes details about the test environment setup, including any specific tools or technologies needed.

- **Test Cases:** It outlines the specific test scenarios, conditions, and steps to be executed during testing. It includes both positive and negative test cases, as well as any special or boundary cases to be considered. 

- **Test Execution:** This section provides guidelines on how the tests will be executed, including the roles and responsibilities of the testing team, the order of test execution, and any specific procedures or criteria for passing or failing tests.

- **Test Data:** It specifies the data required to execute the tests effectively. It may include sample data, predefined datasets, or instructions on creating or obtaining test data.
