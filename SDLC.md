The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) refers to a methodology with clearly defined processes for creating high-quality software. in detail, the SDLC methodology focuses on the following phases of software development:

- Requirement analysis
- Planning
- Software design such as architectural design
- Software development
- Testing
- Deployment

## What is the software development life cycle?

SDLC or the Software Development Life Cycle is a process that produces software with the highest quality and lowest cost in the shortest time possible. SDLC provides a well-structured flow of phases that help an organization to quickly produce high-quality software which is well-tested and ready for production use.

The SDLC involves six phases as explained in the introduction. Popular SDLC models include the [waterfall model](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/definition/waterfall-model), [spiral model](http://searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com/definition/spiral-model), and [Agile model](http://istqbexamcertification.com/what-is-agile-model-advantages-disadvantages-and-when-to-use-it/).


## Examples
The most common SDLC examples or SDLC models are listed below.

### Waterfall Model

This SDLC model is the oldest and most straightforward. With this methodology, we finish one phase and then start the next. Each phase has its own mini-plan and each phase “waterfalls” into the next. The biggest drawback of this model is that small details left incomplete can hold up the entire process.

### Agile Model

The Agile SDLC model separates the product into cycles and delivers a working product very quickly. This methodology produces a succession of releases. Testing of each release feeds back info that’s incorporated into the next version. [According to Robert Half](https://www.roberthalf.com/technology/blog/6-basic-sdlc-methodologies-the-pros-and-cons), the drawback of this model is that the heavy emphasis on customer interaction can lead the project in the wrong direction in some cases.

### Iterative Model

This SDLC model emphasizes repetition. Developers create a version very quickly and for relatively little cost, then test and improve it through rapid and successive versions. One big disadvantage here is that it can eat up resources fast if left unchecked.

### V-Shaped Model

An extension of the waterfall model, this SDLC methodology tests at each stage of development. As with waterfall, this process can run into roadblocks.

### Big Bang Model

This high-risk SDLC model throws most of its resources at development and works best for small projects. It lacks the thorough requirements definition stage of the other methods.

### Spiral Model
The most flexible of the SDLC models, the spiral model is similar to the iterative model in its emphasis on repetition. The spiral model goes through the planning, design, build and test [phases](https://stackify.com/sdlc-phases-identify-problems/) over and over, with gradual improvements at each pass.
