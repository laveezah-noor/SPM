Agile Requirement Engineering includes **four** major best practices:
- The high level interaction between the development team and the customer.
- Iterative approach for Requirement engineering
- Prioritizing the Requirements based on the business value for the customer
- Raising non-functional requirements.

## What is the Agile methodology?
Agile methodology is a project management framework that breaks projects down into several dynamic phases, commonly known as sprints. 

The Agile framework is an iterative methodology. After every sprint, teams reflect and look back to see if there was anything that could be improved so they can adjust their strategy for the next sprint.

### What are the 12 Agile principles?
The 12 principles used in Agile methodology are:

**Satisfy customers through early, continuous improvement and delivery:** When customers receive new updates regularly, they're more likely to see the changes they want within the product. This leads to happier, more satisfied customers—and more recurring revenue.

**Welcome changing requirements, even late in the project:** The Agile framework is all about adaptability. In iterative processes like Agile, being inflexible causes more harm than good. 

**Deliver value frequently:** Similar to principle #1, delivering value to your customers or stakeholders frequently makes it less likely for them to churn. 

**Break the silos of your projects:** Collaboration is key in the Agile framework. The goal is for people to break out of their own individual projects and collaborate together more frequently. 

**Build projects around motivated individuals:** Agile works best when teams are committed and actively working to achieve a goal. 

**The most effective way to communicate is face-to-face:** If you’re working on a distributed team, spend time communicating in ways that involve face-to-face communication like Zoom calls. 

**Working software is the primary measure of progress:** The most important thing that teams should strive for with the Agile framework is the product. The goal here is to prioritize functional software over everything else.

**Maintain a sustainable working pace:** Some aspects of Agile can be fast-paced, but it shouldn't be so fast that team members burn out. The goal is to maintain sustainability throughout the project.

**Continuous excellence enhances agility:** If the team develops excellent code in one sprint, they can continue to build off of it the next. Continually creating great work allows teams to move faster in the future. 

**Simplicity is essential:** Sometimes the simplest solution is the best solution. Agile aims to not overcomplicate things and find simple answers to complex problems. 

**Self-organizing teams generate the most value:** Similar to principle #5, proactive teams become valuable assets to the company as they strive to deliver value.

**Regularly reflect and adjust your way of work to boost effectiveness:** Retrospective meetings are a common Agile practice. It's a dedicated time for teams to look back and reflect on their performance and adapt their behaviors for the future.

## Why is Software Requirement So Important?
- Software Requirement establish the agreement between the team and customer on what application is supposed to do.
- Without a description of what features to include and details of how it will work, the users of the software can't determine if the software will meets their needs.

## Features of Good Requirements
- Trackable
- Clear
- Necessary
- Testable
- Complete
- Comprehensible

### Versus Bad Requirements
- Incomplete
- Non Implementable
- inconsistent
- Incomprehensible
- Not aligned

## Non Functional Requirements in Software Projects
NFR addresses vital issues of Software. If not addressed properly, the results may include:
- Users, client, and developers are unsatisfied.
- Inconsistent software
- Time and money overrun to fix the software which was created without considering the NFRs.

## SRS
- Software Requirements Specification is a comprehensive document which explains the descriptions or details of software product or system which is to be developed with its functional and non functional requirements.
- SRS is developed based on the agreement between the customer and the supplier.
- SRS helps to reduce the time and effort to develop a software.
- To develop a software we should clearly understand the software requirements.

### Users of Requirements
##### System Customers:
- Specify the requirements and read them to check they meets the need. Customers specify the changes to the requirements.
##### Project Managers:
- Use the requirements document to plan a bid for the system and to plan software development process.
##### System Engineers:
- Use the requirements to develop what system is to develop.
##### System Testing Engineers:
- Use the requirements to develop validation test for the software
##### System Maintenance Engineers:
- Use the requirements to understand the system and its relationship between its parts.

## User Stories
- Simple and high level description of feature and functionality of system.
- From the perspective of end user.
- Facilitate the communication between the user and stakeholders.
- It has an actor, action, and benefit.
- User stories are to express the requirements as a scenario rather than a use case but in a simplified form based on
  As an actor, I want this, to get this benefit.

## Use Cases
- structured description of how user will interact with the system to achieve a specific goal.
- includes all expected paths to achieve that goal or alternative path user can take while using the system.
- contains all the expected scenarios.
- **Actor**: Type of user
- **Use case name**: Descriptive name of use case
- **Description**: Overview of Use case i.e. what it is about
- **Pre Conditions:** Conditions to be true before the use case is executed.
- **Main Flow**: Steps to successful execution of use case.
- **Alternative Flow**: different paths and exceptions occur during use case.
- **Post Conditions**: condition true after execution of use case
