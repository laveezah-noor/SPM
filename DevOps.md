DevOps is a set of practices and cultural changes supported by automation tools and lean processes that helps to deliver a software delivery pipeline,
enabling organizations to deliver better quality services and applications faster.

- **Continuous Business Planning:**   
	This starts with identifying the skills, outcomes, and resources needed.
- **Continuous Integration:**
	This starts with development sketch plan and programming.
- **Continuous Testing:**
	Unit and integration testing help increase the efficiency and speed of the development.
- **Continuous Delivery:**
	Continuous delivery is a software development practice that automates the process of making code changes ready for release to production. It involves a deployment pipeline that can create and test multiple environments. It enables teams to release software reliably at any time, either manually or automatically
- **Continuous Deployment:**
	Continuous deployment is a software engineering approach in which software functionalities are delivered frequently and through automated deployments. Code changes to an application are released automatically into the production environment, after passing a series of predefined tests. Continuous deployment enables faster and more reliable software delivery
- **Continuous Monitoring:**
	This is needed to monitor changes and address errors and mistakes spontaneously whenever they happen.

## The DevOps Lifecycle
---
Because of the continuous nature of DevOps, practitioners use the infinity loop to show how the phases of the DevOps lifecycle relate to each other. Despite appearing to flow sequentially, the loop symbolizes the need for constant collaboration and iterative improvement throughout the entire lifecycle.

The DevOps lifecycle consists of eight phases representing the processes, capabilities, and tools needed for development (on the left side of the loop) and operations (on the right side of the loop). Throughout each phase, teams collaborate and communicate to maintain alignment, velocity, and quality.

### Discover

Building software is a team sport. In preparation for the upcoming sprint, teams must workshop to explore, organize, and prioritize ideas. Ideas must align to strategic goals and deliver customer impact. Agile can help guide DevOps teams.

### Plan

DevOps teams should adopt agile practices to improve speed and quality. Agile is an iterative approach to project management and software development that helps teams break work into smaller pieces to deliver incremental value.

### Build

Git is a free and open source version control system. It offers excellent support for branching, merging, and rewriting repository history, which has led to many innovative and powerful workflows and tools for the development build process.

### Test

Continuous integration (CI) allows multiple developers to contribute to a single shared repository. When code changes are merged, automated tests are run to ensure correctness before integration. Merging and testing code often help development teams gain reassurance in the quality and predictability of code once deployed.

### Deploy

Continuous deployment (CD) allows teams to release features frequently into production in an automated fashion. Teams also have the option to deploy with feature flags, delivering new code to users steadily and methodically rather than all at once. This approach improves velocity, productivity, and sustainability of software development teams.

### Operate

Manage the end-to-end delivery of IT services to customers. This includes the practices involved in design, implementation, configuration, deployment, and maintenance of all IT infrastructure that supports an organization’s services.

### Observe

Quickly identify and resolve issues that impact product uptime, speed, and functionality. Automatically notify your team of changes, high-risk actions, or failures, so you can keep services on.

### Continuous feedback

DevOps teams should evaluate each release and generate reports to improve future releases. By gathering continuous feedback, teams can improve their processes and incorporate customer feedback to improve the next release.

## DevOps practices

### Continuous integration

[Continuous integration](https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/continuous-integration) is the practice of automating the integration of code changes into a software project. It allows developers to frequently merge code changes into a central repository where builds and tests are executed. This helps DevOps teams address bugs quicker, improve software quality, and reduce the time it takes to validate and release new software updates.

### Continuous delivery

Continuous delivery expands upon continuous integration by automatically deploying code changes to a testing/production environment. It follows a [continuous delivery pipeline](https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/principles/pipeline), where automated builds, tests, and deployments are orchestrated as one release workflow.

### Situational awareness

It is vital for every member of the organization to have access to the data they need to do their job as effectively and quickly as possible. Team members need to be alerted of failures in the deployment pipeline — whether systemic or due to failed tests — and receive timely updates on the health and performance of applications running in production. Metrics, logs, traces, monitoring, and alerts are all essential sources of feedback teams need to inform their work.

### Automation

Automation is one of the most important DevOps practices because it enables teams to move much more quickly through the process of developing and deploying high-quality software. With automation the simple act of pushing code changes to a source code repository can trigger a build, test, and deployment process that significantly reduces the time these steps take.

### Infrastructure as Code

Whether your organization has an on-premise data center or is completely in the cloud, having the ability to quickly and consistently provision, configure, and manage infrastructure is key to successful DevOps adoption. [Infrastructure as Code](https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/principles/infrastructure-as-code) (IaC) goes beyond simply scripting infrastructure configuration to treating your infrastructure definitions as actual code: using source control, code reviews, tests, etc.

### Microservices

[Microservices](https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/microservices) is an architectural technique where an application is built as a collection of smaller services that can be deployed and operated independently from each other. Each service has its own processes and communicates with other services through an interface. This separation of concerns and decoupled independent function allows for DevOps practices like continuous delivery and continuous integration.

### Monitoring

DevOps teams monitor the entire development lifecycle — from planning, development, integration and testing, deployment, and operations. This allows teams to respond to any degradation in the customer experience, quickly and automatically. More importantly, it allows teams to “shift left” to earlier stages in development and minimize broken production changes.
